# Current architecture

NUVIA is a JavaScript/Python monorepo. Node owns public authorization, MongoDB
persistence, survey collection, team/branch scope, analytics and analysis jobs.
React uses that API on one browser origin. Internal FastAPI owns deterministic
text preparation and validated local model adapters. Trained models are supplied
later by the user/team; model-driven features expose readiness and waiting states.

## Application boundaries

| Owner                      | Path                       | Implemented responsibility                                                                                                           |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Web                        | `apps/web`                 | React/Vite, hash routing, auth/setup UI, connected empty workspaces and explicit design previews                                     |
| API                        | `apps/api`                 | Express, protected sessions/CSRF, account recovery, owner-scoped workspace/branch persistence, Mongoose models and mail processing   |
| Internal AI                | `apps/ai-service`          | Authenticated capabilities/tasks, bounded supported local adapters, model manifests, bilingual preprocessing and evidence validation |
| Public contracts           | `packages/shared-types`    | Shared API prefix/locales and public DTO declarations; no database models or secrets                                                 |
| Development infrastructure | `infra` and `compose.yaml` | Optional local replica set, same-origin nginx routing, API/mail/web images and optional AI scaffold                                  |

JavaScript/JSX and `.mjs` remain in use. The source layout is ready for deliberate feature growth; there is no TypeScript, Redux, React Router or production deployment migration in this change.

## Web ownership

The October 26 approved `Frontend.zip` source under `features/approved-ui` now
owns active page markup, supplied responsive CSS and visual assets. The existing
auth provider and HTTP client remain canonical; `ApprovedWorkspace` routes to
the integrated screens. Former page components remain compatibility/reference
code for retained consumers. See [source ownership](../development/approved-frontend.md).

`src/app/App.jsx` chooses preview mode and composes providers. `app/router` owns route names/access decisions and route orchestration; `features/approved-ui/auth/AuthScreen.jsx` owns active account-screen markup. `app/providers` owns resolved account/workspace state and product shell state. Feature folders own their screen behavior, API clients and local drafts. Supplied `approved-ui` components/styles own active product geometry; `components/ui` and `components/layout` retain shared controls for supplemental account/team flows; `hooks`/`lib` own reusable behavior, transport, assets, localization and formatting.

Account product routes use saved identity/workspace data. `/preview/` is the only owner of synthetic metrics, sample feedback and canned assistant replies. Existing imported design variants are reference/preview code, not implemented product APIs. The shared scale hook preserves the reviewed desktop/mobile geometry.

Private workspace remount keys include actual hash-navigation epochs and saved
account/workspace/role/branch scope. Silent `history.replaceState` updates do not
trigger a later remount merely because the interface locale changes. This keeps
unsaved drafts while preserving resets on real navigation or authorization scope
changes. Committed feedback search travels in the URL fragment so it survives
that protected route remount; it still queries only the server-authorized cohort.

## API ownership

`src/config` resolves the repository root and private configuration independently of package working directory. `modules/auth`, `modules/workspaces` and `modules/mail` implement existing business behavior. `middleware` contains request security, limits and safe errors. `integrations/mail` owns delivery adapters; `integrations/ai-service` owns authenticated task transport, safe capability metadata and independent result validation before persistence. `shared/database` owns connection-scoped Mongoose models and explicit transaction handling.

Product modules implement surveys/revisions/distribution links, responses,
feedback/export, analytics, reports, analysis and team membership/invitations.
Some inherited `users`, `dashboard` and `ai` boundary READMEs describe older
extension guidance; use executable routes and current API docs as authority.
User remains internal to `shared/database/models`; authentication owns accounts.

## Connected request flow

1. Browser requests `/api/v1/auth/session` through Vite or nginx on the same origin.
2. Node resolves a protected cookie session and returns safe user/workspace DTOs plus CSRF context.
3. Mutations require matching Origin/CSRF and strict Zod validation.
4. Services use `deps.models`, owner predicates and explicit sessions for transactional changes.
5. Mail intent is encrypted in the outbox; a separate worker dispatches local development mail or configured SMTP.
6. The web resumes saved setup and renders honest empty/unavailable states.

No browser-to-MongoDB or browser-to-AI path exists. Node calls FastAPI using a
private service key and bounded, already-authorized evidence. Model tasks return
versioned results validated again by Node before persistence. Public links grant
submission access to one branch and immutable survey revision, not workspace reads.
Membership is resolved on each request; revoked access takes effect immediately.

## Model handoff and analysis state

Explicit `AI_PROVIDER=qwen` selects one persistent offline Qwen worker shared by
capability-specific interfaces. The experimental local selection is short report/topic
summaries and reviewed survey drafts in English; Arabic and sentiment/aspects/assistant
remain disabled after actual smoke quality failures. Whole-source citations,
bounded generation, hard timeout recovery and normal Node validation remain in
place. No weights ship in Git. See the [shared Qwen guide](../../apps/ai-service/docs/shared-qwen.md).

An explicit `AI_PROVIDER=gemini` selects the optional HTTPS provider inside
FastAPI for every learned capability: text tasks, embeddings, semantic clustering and
date-bounded forecasting. Default `local` retains all existing model manifests/adapters.
There is no implicit cloud fallback. Gemini credentials belong only to the AI service;
the browser and Node public transport do not receive them. Existing output/evidence
validation still applies; clustering prompts use evidence text (parameter vectors are
not sent) and forecasts must project exactly the supplied futureDates within the
observed 0–10 metric range. Local clustering/forecasting packages remain available
through the local provider selection. Provider-specific model/pipeline
versions preserve provenance; clustering samples never combine different
embedding models/pipelines, even when dimensions match. See the
[online provider guide](../development/gemini-ar.md).

Ignored model packages declare a capability, supported adapter/format, version,
language/taxonomy, device requirements and artifact hashes. No remote code or
implicit weights download is enabled. Builtin language/normalization work without
trained models; learned capabilities wait until compatible packages are ready.
Installing a package changes readiness without rebuilding the web/API. Persistent
jobs and explicit retry preserve provenance; unavailable/failed results never
become successful dashboards. Fixtures remain test-only. See the AI README for
exact supported package formats and model installation commands.

The API process pumps queued jobs; report evidence snapshots and derived datasets
retain their authorized scope. Reports and assistant quotations must map back to
stored original responses. Local testing of plumbing is separate from scientific
quality evaluation of models supplied later.

## Runtime and operational boundaries

Private web GET resources share a bounded in-memory navigation cache with a
30-second freshness window, request deduplication and background revalidation.
Successful writes invalidate active resources. Session reset, workspace selection
and refreshed identity/branch permissions clear cached private results and cancel
old reads. Results are never stored in local/session storage by this cache.
Polled analytics and notification resources refresh while the document is visible.
Workspace selection, business creation and invitation acceptance defer resource invalidation to their
session refresh so no refetch uses the previously selected workspace header.
Scheduled polling bypasses the navigation freshness window and still deduplicates
in-flight reads, so response latency cannot skip the first refresh interval.

Overview insight cards reuse saved report content only when locale, exact cohort
filters and response count match. Owners/managers can generate a scoped report
from the cards; queued, unavailable and failed states remain explicit. Report
timestamps identify saved snapshots; analysis-only updates do not automatically
regenerate an earlier report. No daily scheduler or fabricated recommendation is
introduced.

- JavaScript packages use pinned pnpm workspaces and each app declares its own dependencies. The root owns shared tooling and cross-app browser tests.
- Python dependencies/lockfile are owned by `apps/ai-service`; Python is optional for existing web/API work.
- Root `.env`, `.local/config`, `.local/mail` and test binaries remain root-relative. Production reads process environment only.
- `pnpm dev` starts and stops its own API/mail/web process group. It does not start MongoDB, switch URIs or kill occupied unrelated ports.
- Optional compose uses a separate development MongoDB volume, localhost-bound HTTP web origin and internal database network. It is not production/CD and does not import Atlas data.
- Existing UUID/ObjectId formats, Mongoose index definitions, DTOs, hashing/encryption and transaction invariants are preserved.
